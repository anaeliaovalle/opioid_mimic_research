    "- Below I use PostgresSQL to query MIMIC-3 through a PostgresSQL adapter for Python\n",
    "- Each step for collection is outlined below and the steps build on eachother\n",
    "- Each step will have some relevant info to give context. In the SQL code, if the line starts with \"--\" it's a readable comment for more clarification on what the code does\n",
    "- Once I write the SQL code, it is rendered as a Pandas dataframe, which is a really flexible library for data manipulation. From here, I can export the data to a common output format (.csv, .xslm, .tsv, etc.)"
