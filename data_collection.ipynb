    "# Opioid Study Data Collection\n",
    "#### Defined study plan: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kkTbheDP5vS8rh_C6W1U7qzthkScqrzKBjd0jSY3j48/edit\n",
    "The main pieces consist of:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria\n",
    "2. Demographic Data\n",
    "3. Clinical Data\n",
    "\n",
    "#### About: \n",
    "- Below I use PostgresSQL to query MIMIC-3 through a PostgresSQL adapter for Python\n",
    "- Each step for collection is outlined below and the steps build on eachother\n",
    "- Each step will have some relevant info to give context. In the SQL code, if the line starts with \"--\" it's a readable comment for more clarification on what the code does\n",
    "- Once I write the SQL code, it is rendered as a Pandas dataframe, which is a really flexible library for data manipulation. From here, I can export the data to a common output format (.csv, .xslm, .tsv, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### New Info: \n",
    "- As of meeting on 11/12/2018\n",
    "    - We will NOT be basing our filtering of icu admits on icd9 codes for opioid dependency, nor using the prescriptions table in MIMIC to determine chronic opioid use\n",
    "    - We will exclude all individuals with cancer\n",
    "- #### TODO: Acquire this outpatient prescriptions table\n",
    "    - Plan A) Get new outpatient prescription table via Chahin's colleague\n",
    "    - Plan B) Take time to parse through the patient discharges table to extract prescriptions. This will take time to do :)\n",
    "- #### TODO: Exclude admits with cancer"
