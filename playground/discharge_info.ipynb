As you know, this\\nwas treated with an uncemented Osteonics Omnifit\\nhemiarthroplasty\\non [**2101-10-2**].  This was performed through an\\nanterolateral approach.  His postoperative course was\\nuneventful.\\n Over the ensuing months, he did receive treatment from an\\northopedic surgeon in [**State 108**], whereby he was given\\nviscosupplementation injections of the left knee.  He did not\\nhave any improvement of his knee pain at that time.\\nSubsequently, in [**2102-3-13**], he was admitted with pneumonia.  At\\nthat time, his hip was painful and an x-ray revealed subluxation\\nof the hemiarthroplasty.  Aspiration was positive for infection.\\n\\nThe aspiration white cell count on [**2102-4-11**] was 35,500\\nwith\\n97% polys.  The patient was then taken to the operating room by\\nDr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] who performed a resection of the\\nhemiarthroplasty, irrigation and debridement, and spacer with\\nantibiotic cement.

The patient was then subsequently treated with\\nintravenous antibiotics and the spectrum was widened to include\\nvancomycin, ceftriaxone, and azithromycin.  He was discharged on\\nan antibiotic regimen of vancomycin and ceftriaxone and\\ndemonstrated improvement in his fevers and pain.  He completed\\nfive weeks of intravenous vancomycin.  He developed Clostridium\\ndifficile infection on [**2102-5-16**] which was treated with\\nFlagyl.\\n For this reason, IV antibiotics were discontinued at five weeks\\nrather than six weeks.

As you know, this\\nwas treated with an uncemented Osteonics Omnifit\\nhemiarthroplasty\\non [**2101-10-2**].  This was performed through an\\nanterolateral approach.  His postoperative course was\\nuneventful.\\n Over the ensuing months, he did receive treatment from an\\northopedic surgeon in [**State 108**], whereby he was given\\nviscosupplementation injections of the left knee.  He did not\\nhave any improvement of his knee pain at that time.\\nSubsequently, in [**2102-3-13**], he was admitted with pneumonia.  At\\nthat time, his hip was painful and an x-ray revealed subluxation\\nof the hemiarthroplasty.  Aspiration was positive for infection.\\n\\nThe aspiration white cell count on [**2102-4-11**] was 35,500\\nwith\\n97% polys.  The patient was then taken to the operating room by\\nDr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] who performed a resection of the\\nhemiarthroplasty, irrigation and debridement, and spacer with\\nantibiotic cement.  Tissue culture on [**2102-4-12**] revealed\\ncoagulase negative Staphylococcus as well as propionibacterium\\nacnes.  The patient was then subsequently treated with\\nintravenous antibiotics and the spectrum was widened to include\\nvancomycin, ceftriaxone, and azithromycin.  He was discharged on\\nan antibiotic regimen of vancomycin and ceftriaxone and\\ndemonstrated improvement in his fevers and pain.  He completed\\nfive weeks of intravenous vancomycin.  He developed Clostridium\\ndifficile infection on [**2102-5-16**] which was treated with\\nFlagyl.\\n For this reason, IV antibiotics were discontinued at five weeks\\nrather than six weeks.

He was discharged on\\nan antibiotic regimen of vancomycin and ceftriaxone and\\ndemonstrated improvement in his fevers and pain.  He completed\\nfive weeks of intravenous vancomycin.  He developed Clostridium\\ndifficile infection on [**2102-5-16**] which was treated with\\nFlagyl.\\n For this reason, IV antibiotics were discontinued at five weeks\\nrather than six weeks.

Acute Blood Loss anemia from GI bleed: The patient initially\\npresented to [**Hospital 5871**] Hospital with shortness of breath and chest\\npain; he was found to have a marked anemia, bloody stools, and a\\nsupratherapeutic INR.  He was transfused with pRBCs and\\nstabilized. Evaluation there pointed to a GI source but could\\nnot localize a lesion. During his stay there his home regimen of\\naspirin, Plavix, and coumadin was discontinued due to the risk\\nof exacerbating the GI bleed.  He arrived at [**Hospital1 18**] on a heparin\\ndrip.  He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation. He\\nwas first admitted to the Cardio-Thoracic surgery service for\\nconsideration for replacing the metallic aortic valve with a\\nporcine valve that would not require anti-coagulation.  However,\\ngiven that he had already undergone a re-do sternotomy; it was\\nnot felt safe to open the chest again. After several attempts at\\nlocalizing a lesion, small angioectasias were found in multiple\\nsections of the small bowel.  Also, mild gastritis was found.\\nHowever, no active bleeding was indentified.  Given the\\ndispersed location of the angioectasias included some very\\ndistal lesions, an endoscopic therapeutic option was not\\nfeasible.  His hematocrit was stabilized by the time of\\ndischarge for ~2 weeks as the evaluation continued.  He will be\\ndischarged on a PPI at twice daily dosing to complete 1 month\\nafterwhich he will decrease the dose to daily.  He will be\\nanti-coagulated with coumadin with INR target of 2.5-3.5.  His\\nINR and hematocrit should be closely monitored weekly for 1\\nmonth.  Strict attention should be made to maintain his INR in a\\ntherapeutic range to decrease the likelihood of re-bleeding. His\\nanti-platelet agents were not restarted during this hospital\\nstay due to the risk of re-bleeding would likely outweigh the\\nrisk of in-stent thombosis now 13 months since the placement of\\nthe most recent stent. These medications could be re-considered\\nas an outpatient. His hematocrit at discharge was 28.9 and his\\nINR was 2.7.\\n.\\n2. AV replacement: The patient continued on anti-coagulation\\nwith heparin drip monotherapy while the GI bleed evaluation\\ncontinued.  He was discharged with coumadin as above.\\n.\\n3. CAD, CHF - The patient has an extensive history of coronary\\ndisease including a CABG in [**2180**] and subsequent\\nre-vascularizations.  Given his risk of life-threatening GI\\nbleeding his anti-platelet agents were discontinued.  He\\nremained chest pain free during his hospital stay.  He was\\nwell-compensated from his CHF.  He remained on carvedilol with\\nadequate heart rate and blood pressure control. He remained on a\\nstatin.  Aspirin and plavix were held as above. If his blood\\npressure would tolerate it, he would be a good candidate for\\nadding [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **] to his heart failure regimen.\\n.\\n4. Itch: The patient complained of intense itchiness of his\\nlateral forearms. In talking with the patient's wife this has\\nbeen a chronic problem for him and gets adequate control of the\\nsymptoms with over-the-counter remedies.  The area of concern\\nwas without appreciable skin changes or rash.  He was discharged\\nwith anti-histamines and topical therapies for symptomatic\\nrelief.  An evaluation by an allergist may be of benefit as an\\noutpatient.\\n.\\n5. Diabetes Mellitus type 2: The patient had variable blood\\nsugar control as his diet would vary with regard to procedures\\ndone to evaluate the GI bleeding.  He was followed closely by\\nthe [**Last Name (un) **] Diabetes consult service to titrate his insulin\\ndosing.  He will be discharged with glargine insulin and humalog\\nsliding scale.\\n.\\n6. Chronic kidney disease - The patient has a baseline chronic\\nkidney disease likely related to diabetes, hypertension and\\nresidual damage from IV contrast administration.  He remained\\nclose to his baseline Cr throughout his hospital stay except for\\na mild rise which was thought secondary to pre-renal azotemia\\nfrom inadequate oral intake.  His creatinine recovered to his\\nbaseline with oral hydration.\\n.\\n7. Hypertension: The patient had stable blood pressure on home\\nblood pressure regimen.\\n.\\n8.

His postoperative course was\\nuneventful.\\n Over the ensuing months, he did receive treatment from an\\northopedic surgeon in [**State 108**], whereby he was given\\nviscosupplementation injections of the left knee.  He did not\\nhave any improvement of his knee pain at that time.\\nSubsequently, in [**2102-3-13**], he was admitted with pneumonia.  At\\nthat time, his hip was painful and an x-ray revealed subluxation\\nof the hemiarthroplasty.  Aspiration was positive for infection.\\n\\nThe aspiration white cell count on [**2102-4-11**] was 35,500\\nwith\\n97% polys.  The patient was then taken to the operating room by\\nDr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] who performed a resection of the\\nhemiarthroplasty, irrigation and debridement, and spacer with\\nantibiotic cement.

She was\\nadmitted after pulmonary vein isolation complicated by atrial\\ntachycardia requiring cardioversion and SOB from pulm edema\\nrequiring post-procedure re-intubation.\\n\\nThe patient was admitted for elective pulmonary vein isolation.\\nBoth groin veins were accessed for the procedure. At the end of\\nthe procedure, she developed atrial tachycardia with 2:1 block\\nat a rate of approximately 100. This atrial tach was not ablated\\nthough she was cardioverted back to NSR. She was successfully\\nextubated after cardioversion. She had received an estimated\\n4.5L of fluid during the procedure. She developed shortness of\\nbreath after extubation. Exam and CXR were concerning for\\npulmonary edema. She responded well to 40mg IV lasix x2 with an\\nestimated 3L urine output. Nonetheless, the patient's shortness\\nof breath worsened, saturating 92% on NRB and speaking in short\\nsentences.

No evidence of hardware fracture, or fracture\\nof the right pelvis or right femur.\\n2. Benign-appearing lucency of the left femoral neck as\\ndescribed above.\\n.\\n[**4-9**] TTE: The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild\\nsymmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular\\ncavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic\\nfunction is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). [Intrinsic left\\nventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the\\nseverity of valvular regurgitation.] The aortic root is mildly\\ndilated. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic arch\\nis mildly dilated. A mechanical aortic valve prosthesis is\\npresent. The transaortic gradient is probably mildly elevated\\nfor this type of prosthesis (although some elevation is expected\\nin the presence of tachycardia). Trace aortic regurgitation is\\nseen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate\\n(2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The mitral regurgitation jet\\nis eccentric. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.\\nThere is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is\\nno pericardial effusion.\\nCompared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable\\nfor review) of [**2194-5-27**], the aortic valve gradient is similar.\\nMitral regurgitation may now be slightly more prominent.\\n.\\n[**4-10**] Hip Films: There has been placement of a bipolar\\nhemiarthroplasty within the right hip. There are no signs for\\nhardware complications. No bony fractures are identified. There\\nis a lateral surgical skin staples seen.\\n.\\n[**4-10**] EEG: Mildly abnormal EEG in the waking and drowsy states\\ndue to\\nthe mild slowing of the background with occasional bursts of\\ngeneralized\\nslowing. This suggests a mild encephalopathy although some\\nbackground\\nfrequencies were normal. Medications, metabolic disturbances,\\nand\\ninfection are among the most common causes. There were no focal\\nabnormalities or epileptiform features. A tachycardia was noted.\\n\\n.\\n[**4-14**] Difficult Crossmatch: DIAGNOSIS, ASSESSMENT AND\\nRECOMMENDATIONS: Mr. [**Known lastname **] has newly identified red cell\\nalloantibodies, anti-Cw and anti-Jkb, as well as a previously\\nidentified, anti-E. All of these antibodies can cause hemolytic\\ntransfusion reactions. E and Cw are members of the Rh blood\\ngroup system while Jkb is a member of the Kidd blood group\\nsystem. In the future he should receive red cells that are Jkb,\\nE, and Cw negative.\\n.\\n[**4-16**] Hip Films: A single frontal radiograph of the right hip\\ndemonstrates the patient to be status post right hip\\nhemiarthroplasty.

Tubing overlying the right hip may\\nrepresent a surgical drain.\\n.\\n[**4-16**] TEE: The left atrium is normal in size. No mass or thrombus\\nis seen in the right atrium or right atrial appendage. No atrial\\nseptal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Overall left\\nventricular systolic function is moderately depressed. The right\\nventricular cavity is mildly dilated. There is moderate global\\nright ventricular free wall hypokinesis. The ascending,\\ntransverse and descending thoracic aorta are normal in diameter\\nand free of atherosclerotic plaque. A bileaflet aortic valve\\nprosthesis is present. A mechanical aortic valve prosthesis is\\npresent. The aortic prosthesis leaflets appear to move normally.\\nNo masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. No aortic\\nvalve abscess is seen. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. [Due\\nto acoustic shadowing, the severity of aortic regurgitation may\\nbe significantly UNDERestimated.] There is a probable vegetation\\non the mitral valve.

Postoperatively he was taken to\\nthe cardiac surgical intensive care unit for monitoring. On\\npostoperative day one, Mr. [**Known lastname 5872**] [**Last Name (Titles) 5058**] neurologically intact\\nand was extubated. Aspirn, plavix, beta blockade and a statin\\nwere resumed. Coumadin was started for anticoagulation for his\\nmechanical aortic valve. He developed atrial fibrillation for\\nwhich amiodarone was started with conversion to normal sinus\\nrhythm. On postoperative day two, he was transferred to the\\ncardiac surgical nursing floor for further recovery. Mr. [**Known lastname 5872**]\\nwas gently diuresed towards his preoperative weight. The\\nphysical therapy service was consulted for assistance with his\\npostoperative strength and mobility. A psychiatry consult was\\nobtained for some postoperative confusion and crying episodes.\\nFluoxetine was continued and frequent family/staf reorientation\\nwas encouraged. One month follow-up was recommended. Mr. [**Known lastname 5872**]\\ndeveloped sternal drainage and vancomycin and levaquin was\\nstarted. Vancomycin was discontinued on [**4-2**], he has remained\\nafebrile with a normal WBC.  His sternal drainage has subsided,\\nand he is ready to be discharged today.

Acute Blood Loss anemia from GI bleed: The patient initially\\npresented to [**Hospital 5871**] Hospital with shortness of breath and chest\\npain; he was found to have a marked anemia, bloody stools, and a\\nsupratherapeutic INR.  He was transfused with pRBCs and\\nstabilized. Evaluation there pointed to a GI source but could\\nnot localize a lesion. During his stay there his home regimen of\\naspirin, Plavix, and coumadin was discontinued due to the risk\\nof exacerbating the GI bleed.  He arrived at [**Hospital1 18**] on a heparin\\ndrip.  He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation. He\\nwas first admitted to the Cardio-Thoracic surgery service for\\nconsideration for replacing the metallic aortic valve with a\\nporcine valve that would not require anti-coagulation.  However,\\ngiven that he had already undergone a re-do sternotomy; it was\\nnot felt safe to open the chest again. After several attempts at\\nlocalizing a lesion, small angioectasias were found in multiple\\nsections of the small bowel.  Also, mild gastritis was found.\\nHowever, no active bleeding was indentified.  Given the\\ndispersed location of the angioectasias included some very\\ndistal lesions, an endoscopic therapeutic option was not\\nfeasible.  His hematocrit was stabilized by the time of\\ndischarge for ~2 weeks as the evaluation continued.  He will be\\ndischarged on a PPI at twice daily dosing to complete 1 month\\nafterwhich he will decrease the dose to daily.  He will be\\nanti-coagulated with coumadin with INR target of 2.5-3.5.  His\\nINR and hematocrit should be closely monitored weekly for 1\\nmonth.  Strict attention should be made to maintain his INR in a\\ntherapeutic range to decrease the likelihood of re-bleeding. His\\nanti-platelet agents were not restarted during this hospital\\nstay due to the risk of re-bleeding would likely outweigh the\\nrisk of in-stent thombosis now 13 months since the placement of\\nthe most recent stent. These medications could be re-considered\\nas an outpatient. His hematocrit at discharge was 28.9 and his\\nINR was 2.7.\\n.\\n2. AV replacement: The patient continued on anti-coagulation\\nwith heparin drip monotherapy while the GI bleed evaluation\\ncontinued.  He was discharged with coumadin as above.\\n.\\n3. CAD, CHF - The patient has an extensive history of coronary\\ndisease including a CABG in [**2180**] and subsequent\\nre-vascularizations.  Given his risk of life-threatening GI\\nbleeding his anti-platelet agents were discontinued.  He\\nremained chest pain free during his hospital stay.  He was\\nwell-compensated from his CHF.  He remained on carvedilol with\\nadequate heart rate and blood pressure control. He remained on a\\nstatin.  Aspirin and plavix were held as above. If his blood\\npressure would tolerate it, he would be a good candidate for\\nadding [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **] to his heart failure regimen.\\n.\\n4. Itch: The patient complained of intense itchiness of his\\nlateral forearms. In talking with the patient's wife this has\\nbeen a chronic problem for him and gets adequate control of the\\nsymptoms with over-the-counter remedies.  The area of concern\\nwas without appreciable skin changes or rash.  He was discharged\\nwith anti-histamines and topical therapies for symptomatic\\nrelief.  An evaluation by an allergist may be of benefit as an\\noutpatient.\\n.\\n5. Diabetes Mellitus type 2: The patient had variable blood\\nsugar control as his diet would vary with regard to procedures\\ndone to evaluate the GI bleeding.  He was followed closely by\\nthe [**Last Name (un) **] Diabetes consult service to titrate his insulin\\ndosing.  He will be discharged with glargine insulin and humalog\\nsliding scale.\\n.\\n6. Chronic kidney disease - The patient has a baseline chronic\\nkidney disease likely related to diabetes, hypertension and\\nresidual damage from IV contrast administration.  He remained\\nclose to his baseline Cr throughout his hospital stay except for\\na mild rise which was thought secondary to pre-renal azotemia\\nfrom inadequate oral intake.  His creatinine recovered to his\\nbaseline with oral hydration.\\n.\\n7. Hypertension: The patient had stable blood pressure on home\\nblood pressure regimen.\\n.\\n8. AFIB: There were no acute issues. He remained well rate\\ncontrolled with his carvedilol. He was anti-coagulated as above.\\n\\n.\\n9. Depression: There were no acute issues, and he remained on\\nhis home regimen.\\n.\\n10. FEN: diabetic, cardiac diet\\n11. PPX: No bowel regimen needed, PPI, heparin gtt\\n12. CODE: Full\\n13.
